# Paywall — Core Concepts

---

## 1. Invisible Graduation

The tiers map to a collector's journey, not their wallet. As collecting deepens, the tools you need naturally deepen too. The upgrade never feels like "pay more to see expensive things." It feels like "I've gotten more serious and now I need more serious tools."

The user never encounters a limit, a budget, or a ceiling. They encounter a **next level of capability** that becomes relevant exactly when they're ready for it.

```
Free:         "Browse the market"         — I'm curious
Pro:          "Stay current"              — I'm buying
Collector:    "See what others miss"      — I'm evaluating
Inner Circle: "See it first"             — I'm competing
```

---

## 2. Intelligence Depth, Not Access Breadth

Every tier sees the same market. The difference is how deep you see into it.

- **Free** sees the catalog (delayed)
- **Pro** sees the catalog in real time
- **Collector** sees the catalog in real time + the hidden layer (smith pedigree signals, "capable of" arbitrage, unlisted-price intelligence, certification upside)
- **Inner Circle** sees that hidden layer before anyone else

Nobody is locked out of inventory. Higher tiers see **more signal** in the same inventory.

---

## 3. The Invisible Cap

Mechanically, Pro alerts are price-capped (~¥5M). But the user never sees a number. They experience Collector as "deeper matching" — more results, richer signals, opportunities Pro's algorithm doesn't surface.

Rules:
- The words "budget", "limit", "cap", "spending range" never appear in UI
- The threshold is fuzzy (not a clean round number) so it can't be reverse-engineered
- "Additional matches found with Collector" — not "items above your limit"
- The cap only matters when the user has outgrown it, at which point the upgrade is obvious and proportional

---

## 4. Behavior-Triggered Gates

The paywall appears only when the user's own actions reveal they've outgrown their tier. It's not a wall they walk into — it's a door that becomes visible exactly when they need to walk through it.

| You do this... | ...which reveals | ...and the gate is |
|---|---|---|
| Save a search, send an inquiry | "I'm actively buying" | Pro |
| Browse 7 days late, things keep selling | "Speed costs me real opportunities" | Pro |
| Read setsumei preview, want the rest | "I evaluate Juyo-level pieces" | Collector |
| Explore an artist's profile, data is gated | "I research smith pedigree before buying" | Collector |
| Get "additional matches" in monthly summary | "My searches are finding things I'm not seeing" | Collector |
| Want off-market inventory, community | "I've exhausted public supply" | Inner Circle |

---

## 5. "Capable Of" — The Moat

Our unique advantage: we cross-reference live dealer inventory with Yuhinkai certification records for 13,566 artisans.

A TokuHo piece by a smith with 47 Juyo designations is an arbitrage opportunity — buy at ¥3M, submit to Juyo shinsa, it passes, it's worth ¥12M. Nobody else can systematically surface this signal. We can.

This is the core Collector value: seeing what others miss. Not more items — more **meaning** in the same items.

---

## 6. Proportional Conversion

Conversion tools are concrete, factual, and never pushy. They give the user the information to calculate their own cost of not upgrading.

- **Delayed Items Card:** "12 new items this week. 2 Juyo." (Concrete, not hypothetical)
- **"Sold before delay ended":** "3 items matching your interests sold this week." (Factual loss, not manufactured urgency)
- **"Additional matches":** "3 additional matches found with Collector intelligence." (Capability gap, not spending gate)

The user draws their own conclusion. We never say "you're missing out" — we show them what's there and let the math speak.

---

## 7. The Natural Progression

The collector's actual hobby journey:

```
Discovers nihonto → browses (Free)
    ↓
Starts buying ¥500K-3M pieces → needs speed, alerts (Pro)
    ↓
Starts evaluating Juyo pieces → needs smith data, setsumei, pedigree signals (Collector)
    ↓
Competes for rare pieces → needs time priority, dealer relationships (Inner Circle)
```

Each tier upgrade is a milestone the collector reaches on their own. We don't push them up the ladder — we make the next rung available when they arrive at it.

---

## 8. The Tier Is a Credential

The subscription isn't "pay for features." It's **"pay for a seat at the table."**

A Collector or Inner Circle membership signals to Japanese dealers: this person is knowledgeable, financially capable, and serious. Because tire kickers don't pay $99/month for smith pedigree analytics and setsumei translations.

This is how high-end art markets work. Sotheby's client tiers are exactly this — higher tier = access to the room where the real deals happen. The software features are just the mechanism. The credential is the product.

**Why this matters for nihonto specifically:**
- Japanese elite dealers are cautious about foreign buyers (language, trust, cultural protocol)
- The best inventory often never reaches the public website
- A Western collector emailing a Japanese dealer has no way to signal seriousness
- Our platform can vouch for them — the subscription tier is a letter of introduction

**The credential surfaces through:**
- **Inquiry emails:** "Inquiry via NihontoWatch Collector" in the email signature. Dealers learn that these inquiries are worth responding to.
- **Private offers:** Dealers share pre-market, estate, or withdrawal-price items with the credentialed audience instead of building their own CRM.
- **Community:** Inner Circle members interact with each other and with dealers in a space where everyone is verified serious.

**The flywheel:**
```
Serious collectors join (credentialed audience)
    → Dealers trust the audience → share better inventory
    → Better inventory → more serious collectors join
    → Larger credentialed audience → dealers share even more
    → Platform becomes the room where deals happen
```

Features can be copied. The credentialed network can't.

## 9. Clean Browse, Deep Profiles

The browse grid is sacred. No badges, no blurs, no lock icons, no "upgrade to see this" clutter. The browse experience is the same for every user (minus the 7-day delay). This is how you become the default first stop — the free experience has to be excellent.

The **artist profile page** is the natural conversion surface for Collector. The artisan name on every listing card is already clickable → links to `/artists/[slug]`. Users follow their own curiosity:

```
See "Osafune Kanemitsu" on a listing card
    ↓
Click → land on artist profile
    ↓
See certification pyramid: 47 Juyo, 5 TJ (free — this is the hook)
    ↓
Scroll to blade form stats, mei analysis, elite factor → gated
    ↓
That's the Collector moment. They went looking for depth and found it.
```

"Capable of" intelligence surfaces in exactly two places:
- **Artist profile** — behind the Collector gate (the data is there when you go looking)
- **Collector alert emails** — "TokuHo by a smith with 47 Juyo designations"

Not on the browse card. Never on the browse card.

## Applying the Framework

Every feature decision should pass through these questions:

1. **Which collecting depth does this serve?** If it only matters to serious collectors, it's Collector. If it matters to anyone actively buying, it's Pro.

2. **Does the gate feel like a natural next step?** If the user would say "of course that's a premium feature," the gate is right. If they'd say "why can't I see this?" the gate is wrong.

3. **Is the framing about capability, not restriction?** "See what others miss" vs. "pay to unlock." Same feature, opposite emotions.

4. **Would the user discover the gate through their own behavior?** The best gate is one the user walks into because their actions naturally led them there, not one we placed in front of them.

5. **Is the subscription cost invisible relative to the purchase?** $25/mo on ¥1M purchases. $99/mo on ¥10M purchases. The ratio should always feel trivial.

6. **Does it keep the browse grid clean?** If a feature adds visual noise to listing cards for conversion purposes, it's wrong. The browse experience is the product. Conversion happens in deeper surfaces (artist profiles, saved search management, alert summaries).

7. **Does the tier serve as a credential?** The subscription should make the user more effective in the real world — not just on our platform. A Collector member's inquiry carries more weight with dealers. An Inner Circle member gets access to inventory that doesn't exist publicly. The tier opens doors beyond the software.

## The Community Question

The community layer is where the credential becomes most powerful. But it needs careful design — it's the hardest thing to get right and the most valuable thing to have.

**What the community is NOT:**
- A general nihonto forum (NMB already exists, we don't compete with it)
- A social network with profiles, likes, followers
- A place for beginners to ask basic questions

**What the community IS:**
- A credentialed space where every participant is verified serious
- A channel where dealers can reach qualified buyers directly
- A place for market intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else (shinsa results, pre-market whispers, valuation discussions)
- A network effect that makes the platform defensible

**Possible structure:**
- **Collector tier:** Community read access — see discussions, learn from peers, absorb market intelligence. Can't post (this keeps signal-to-noise high and makes Inner Circle more attractive).
- **Inner Circle tier:** Full participation — post, discuss, message, interact with dealers. The credential is strongest here. Dealers know everyone in this space has skin in the game.
- **Dealer tier:** Dealer-verified presence — can post private offers, respond to inquiries, share market context. Their participation is the supply side of the flywheel.

**The credentialed inquiry enhancement:**
When a Collector+ member sends an inquiry through our platform, the email includes a verified sender signature that dealers learn to recognize. Not "this person pays us money" — more like a trust mark. Over time, dealers learn: inquiries with the NihontoWatch credential get responded to, inquiries without it go to the bottom of the pile. This makes the credential self-reinforcing.

**What makes this different from Discord/LINE groups that already exist:**
- Verified spending-level identity (you can't fake your tier)
- Integrated with the inventory platform (discuss a specific listing, click through to it)
- Dealer participation is structured (private offers, not just chat)
- The credential travels outside the community (into inquiry emails, into dealer relationships)

---

## Inner Circle: Application, Not Paywall

Inner Circle should be application-based, not open purchase. The credential's value depends on exclusivity. If anyone can pay $249 and get in, the signal to dealers weakens. If you have to apply, the credential means "this person was vetted."

**Application model:**
- Brief form: "What do you collect? What's your collecting history? What are you looking for?"
- Not gatekeeping for its own sake — gives us information to serve them better and filters for seriousness
- Rejection rate doesn't need to be high — the existence of a filter is what signals curation

**What Inner Circle becomes:**
- A verified identity that Japanese dealers trust
- Access to inventory that isn't public
- A network of peers at the same level
- The knowledge that everyone in the room passed the same bar

That's a club, not a subscription. Clubs are stickier. Nobody cancels their membership at the club where the best dealers know them by name.

**Critical tension:** The more valuable the credential becomes, the more important it is that the free experience remains excellent. If the platform becomes "pay to talk to dealers," the free experience feels hollow and we lose the SEO/traffic foundation. The catalog is always the product. The tiers add depth and access on top of a genuinely great free experience.
